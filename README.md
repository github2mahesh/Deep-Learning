# Deep Learning

This repository showcases lab assignments completed in a **Deep Learning** course. It provides examples of building, training, and evaluating deep neural networks using various frameworks and libraries.



**Welcome!** This repository contains my lab assignments from the **Deep Learning** course.

**What will you find here?**

* **Three Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb):** Each notebook represents a different lab assignment, containing the code for:
    * **Building deep neural network architectures:** Implementing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or other relevant architectures depending on the lab focus.
    * **Training and evaluating models:** Utilizing appropriate loss functions, optimizers, and evaluation metrics to train the models and assess their performance.
    * **Data pre-processing and visualization:** Preparing data for deep learning by cleaning, transforming, and visualizing it to understand its characteristics.
    * **Experimentation and analysis:** Exploring hyperparameters, analyzing results, and interpreting the model's behavior.


**Disclaimer:** This repository serves as a personal learning portfolio and does not claim to provide complete solutions or code for specific assignments. It is intended to showcase learning progress and applied skills in building and utilizing deep learning models.
